# Backup & export runbook

How to back up and restore the cafe order dashboard database. Written for a non-technical operator. No secrets belong in this file or in the git repo.

**Live app:** https://bubu-tracker.netlify.app/  
**Supabase project ref:** `ybmrdsnqquryrdiqglng` (free tier; RLS on all tables)

**Tables (restore-safe order — parents before children):**

1. `products`
2. `modifier_groups`
3. `customers`
4. `orders`
5. `order_items`
6. `settings`

## 1. What is at risk and why

All order and customer history for the live business lives in a single Supabase free-tier Postgres database. Free tier has **no point-in-time recovery (PITR)** — if data is deleted or corrupted, you cannot roll back to an earlier moment unless you already have a backup. The `products` table’s rows vanished once for unknown reasons and were only noticed when a production order failed to save. There is no automated backup. This document is the manual procedure until something better is set up.

---

## 2. Option A — Manual CSV export (recommended for the owner)

Do this from a browser. No command line required.

### Cadence

- **At least once a month**
- **Again immediately before every schema migration** (any change under `supabase/migrations/` applied by hand)

### Folder naming

On your computer (Desktop, iCloud Drive, Google Drive, or an external drive — **not** inside this project folder), create a folder named:

```text
cafe-backup-YYYY-MM-DD
```

Example: `cafe-backup-2026-07-28`

Keep that folder somewhere durable. Prefer a cloud drive or a second machine so a single laptop failure does not lose the only copy.

### Tap-by-tap export

1. Open [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) and sign in.
2. Open the project for this cafe (project ref `ybmrdsnqquryrdiqglng`).
3. In the left sidebar, click **Table Editor**.
4. For **each** table below, in this order:
   1. Click the table name in the left list.
   2. Wait until the rows load.
   3. Find the export control (often near the top right of the table view — a menu or **Export** / download action). Choose **Export as CSV** (wording may vary slightly by Supabase UI version).
   4. Save the file into your dated folder.
   5. Name each file clearly, for example:

| Order | Table | Suggested filename |
|------:|-------|--------------------|
| 1 | `products` | `01-products.csv` |
| 2 | `modifier_groups` | *skip — see note below* |
| 3 | `customers` | `03-customers.csv` |
| 4 | `orders` | `04-orders.csv` |
| 5 | `order_items` | `05-order_items.csv` |
| 6 | `settings` | `06-settings.csv` |

> **`modifier_groups` is expected to be empty — skip it.** The Table Editor
> refuses to export a table with no rows ("The table modifier_groups has no rows
> to export"); that is a UI limitation, not a failed backup. The table is
> vestigial: it has a full adapter CRUD surface but no caller anywhere in the
> app. The modifiers the app actually uses are hardcoded in
> `src/domain/contracts.ts` and assigned per product in `src/domain/catalog.ts`,
> and each cup's chosen options are stored as jsonb on `order_items.modifiers`,
> which `05-order_items.csv` already captures. Record it in `MANIFEST.txt` as
> `modifier_groups=0 (expected, table unused)` and move on. If this table ever
> does contain rows, stop and find out what wrote them before proceeding.

5. Confirm the dated folder contains **five** CSV files before you close the
   browser (six tables, minus the skipped `modifier_groups`).

If the UI has changed and you cannot find Export, use the table’s overflow menu (⋯) or check Supabase’s current docs for “export table CSV” — do not invent SQL or CLI steps for Option A.

## 3. Option B — `pg_dump` (for a developer)

Use this only if you are comfortable with a terminal and Postgres tools. The owner can stick to Option A.

### Connection string (never commit it)

1. Supabase Dashboard → project → **Project Settings** → **Database**.
2. Copy the **connection string** (URI) from there.
3. Treat it as a secret. **Never** paste it into this repo, into a committed `.env`, into a PR, or into chat logs that get archived. Prefer pasting it only into your local terminal session, or into a local secret store outside git.

Placeholders used below:

- `<CONNECTION_STRING_FROM_SUPABASE_DASHBOARD>` — the URI from Project Settings → Database  
- `<YOUR_PROJECT_REF>` — e.g. `ybmrdsnqquryrdiqglng`  
- Store dump files **outside** the git repo (e.g. `~/Backups/cafe/` or an external drive).

### Full dump (schema + data)

```sh
pg_dump "<CONNECTION_STRING_FROM_SUPABASE_DASHBOARD>" \
  --format=custom \
  --file="$HOME/Backups/cafe/cafe-full-<YOUR_PROJECT_REF>-YYYY-MM-DD.dump"
```

### Data-only dump

```sh
pg_dump "<CONNECTION_STRING_FROM_SUPABASE_DASHBOARD>" \
  --data-only \
  --format=custom \
  --file="$HOME/Backups/cafe/cafe-data-<YOUR_PROJECT_REF>-YYYY-MM-DD.dump"
```

Replace `YYYY-MM-DD` with the real date. Create `$HOME/Backups/cafe/` first if it does not exist. Do not place dump files under the `order-dashboard` project directory.

---

## 4. Restore procedure

**Warning:** Restoring into a live database can break foreign keys if tables are loaded out of order. Prefer restoring during a maintenance window when no one is taking new orders. If you are unsure, get a developer involved before writing to production.

### Foreign-key order (why it matters)

- `order_items.order_id` **cascades** when an order is deleted (`orders` → `order_items`).
- `orders.customer_id` does **not** cascade from `customers`. Customers must exist before orders that reference them.
- `order_items` also references `products`. Products must exist before order items.

Always load **parents before children**:

1. `products`
2. `modifier_groups` — normally nothing to load; no CSV is exported for it (see section 3)
3. `customers`
4. `orders`
5. `order_items`
6. `settings`

### From Option A (CSV)

1. Open Supabase → **Table Editor**.
2. If you are replacing bad or missing data, decide per table whether you need to clear conflicting rows first. Deleting live rows is irreversible without a backup — stop if unsure.
3. Import each CSV in the restore-safe order above (table → import/insert from CSV if available in the UI).
4. Do **not** import `order_items` before `orders` and `products`, or `orders` before `customers`. Out-of-order imports commonly fail with foreign-key errors or leave half-restored data.
5. After all six tables, run the verification checks in section 5.

Exact import click labels vary by Supabase version. If bulk CSV import is unavailable in the Table Editor for your project, a developer should use the SQL editor or Option B tools rather than guessing.

### From Option B (`pg_dump`)

Full custom-format dump (restores schema + data as packaged by `pg_dump`):

```sh
pg_restore \
  --dbname="<CONNECTION_STRING_FROM_SUPABASE_DASHBOARD>" \
  --clean \
  --if-exists \
  "$HOME/Backups/cafe/cafe-full-<YOUR_PROJECT_REF>-YYYY-MM-DD.dump"
```

Data-only restore (schema already exists):

```sh
pg_restore \
  --dbname="<CONNECTION_STRING_FROM_SUPABASE_DASHBOARD>" \
  --data-only \
  --disable-triggers \
  "$HOME/Backups/cafe/cafe-data-<YOUR_PROJECT_REF>-YYYY-MM-DD.dump"
```

`--clean` drops existing objects before recreate — that is destructive on a live project. Confirm the target and take a fresh backup first. Prefer a developer for production restore.

If restoring table-by-table from SQL or CSV instead of a single dump, still use the parent-before-child order above.

---

## 5. Verification

A backup is only useful if it actually contains data. After every export (and after every restore), check:

### CSV (Option A)

1. Open each file in a spreadsheet app or text editor.
2. Confirm it is **not** empty (more than just a header row, unless that table truly has zero rows).
3. Sanity-check approximate row counts against what you see in Supabase Table Editor for the same day:

| Table | Sanity check |
|-------|----------------|
| `products` | **Exactly six** rows for the closed catalog. **More than six** means extra rows exist under different names — treat that as a known open item and investigate; do not silently “fix” by deleting without a plan. **Fewer than six** may mean catalog loss (the failure mode that already happened once). |
| `modifier_groups` | **Expected empty — no CSV file.** Confirmed 2026-07-29: the table is unused by the app. Rows appearing here are a signal to investigate, not a backup to verify. |
| `customers` | Roughly matches the customer list you expect (order of magnitude is enough). |
| `orders` | Roughly matches order history volume. |
| `order_items` | Should be **at least** as many rows as orders (usually more). Zero items with many orders is wrong. |
| `settings` | Usually a small fixed set of rows; empty may mean defaults only or a problem — compare to Table Editor. |

4. Optionally write the counts into a one-line `MANIFEST.txt` in the same dated folder, e.g. `products=6 modifier_groups=0 (expected, table unused) customers=… orders=…`.

### `pg_dump` (Option B)

1. Confirm the dump file size is not zero.
2. Optionally list contents: `pg_restore --list path/to/file.dump | head` (should show tables/data, not an empty listing).
3. After restore, compare row counts in Table Editor (or SQL `count(*)`) to the pre-restore numbers you recorded.

## 6. Pre-migration checklist

Run this **before** applying any versioned SQL file from `supabase/migrations/` by hand in a maintenance window:

1. [ ] Tell anyone who uses the dashboard that orders will pause for the window.
2. [ ] Complete a full Option A CSV export into a new `cafe-backup-YYYY-MM-DD` folder — five files, since `modifier_groups` is expected empty and is skipped (and/or Option B dump if a developer is present).
3. [ ] Verify the backup (section 5) — especially `products` = 6 and non-empty `orders` / `order_items` if you had production traffic.
4. [ ] Note the migration filename you will apply and keep it open side by side with this checklist.
5. [ ] Prefer applying migrations only when you can stay at the computer until verification finishes.
6. [ ] After the migration: spot-check Table Editor row counts, try loading the live app (https://bubu-tracker.netlify.app/), and confirm a sample order still looks correct.
7. [ ] If anything looks wrong: **stop**, do not run further SQL, and restore from the backup you just made (section 4).

Migrations in this project are applied **manually**; this checklist is not automated.

## 7. What is explicitly out of scope

This document only records **manual** backup and restore steps.

**Not set up by this runbook:**

- Scheduled / automated backups
- Supabase paid-tier PITR (point-in-time recovery)
- GitHub Actions or cron jobs that dump the database
- Off-site replication or multi-region failover

**What it would take to automate later (notes only — do not implement from this file):**

- Upgrade off free tier if PITR is required, **or**
- A scheduled job (e.g. monthly cron or CI) that runs `pg_dump` with a secret connection string stored outside git, writes dated files to encrypted object storage, and alerts if the job fails or file size is zero
- Periodic restore drills so the procedure is proven, not only written down

Until then: monthly CSVs + a backup before every migration are the safety net.
